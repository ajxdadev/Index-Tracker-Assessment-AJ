Index Construction API
• POST /build-index
o Inputs: start_date, end_date (optional).

§ Select top 100 stocks daily by market cap.
§ Assign equal weights.

§ Cache results in Redis.

• Important: Index building must happen at API runtime, not during ingestion. Ensure
you understand the principles behind equal weighSng, including how noSonal
weights are assigned and rebalanced.
